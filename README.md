Cryptoanarchistic repository builder
====================================
#
Tooling for building a Debian repository containing interconnected, well-working applications.

![Logo of cryptoanarchistic Debian repository](docs/logo.svg)

Motivation
----------

* If you install `gnome-desktop`, `apt` also installs X server and configures everything properly
* If you install `gimp`, `apt` knows which libraries it needs
* If you install `apache`, `mysql`, `php` it works out-of-the-box

**Make Bitcoin apps work similarly**, examples:

* `sudo apt install btcpayserver` installs `btcpayserver`, `bitcoind`, `nginx`, `tor` connects them together and generates an `onion` address for you
* `sudo apt install electrs` is smart enough to turn off pruning
* `sudo apt install ridetheln` installs `lnd`, `bitcoind` without pruning, `nginx`, `tor`...
* All applications integrate nicely with existing Debian features (e.g. system database).

You should get the point at this point. :) It actually works now, if you setup the repository (read below).

However, there are still some pain points! The biggest ones is inconvenience when accessing your node remotely.
While the software was tested quite a lot and it seems to be working really well, it's not yet considered stable!

Supported applications

Plus several internal tools to improve security and UX. Read below for the complete list.

If you want to try it out, see `docs/` directory to learn the details.

How to setup the beta Debian repository
---------------------------------------

**Please read the [docs](docs/user-level.md#what-you-need-to-know-before-installing-anything-from-this-repository) before you start!** Only Debian 10 (Buster) is currently tested, distributions based
on it (Ubuntu, Mint...) should work too and I'll be happy to recieve reports if you try them.

To use the produced repository you need to also setup Microsoft dotnet repository. Follow these steps
and don't forget to [verify fingerprints](https://gist.github.com/Kixunil/fb7300edcb8a8afc95e6b7b727b31f0d).

```
gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3D9E81D3CA76CDCBE768C4B4DC6B4F8E60B8CF4C
gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BC528686B50D79E339D3721CEB3E94ADBE1229CF
gpg --export 3D9E81D3CA76CDCBE768C4B4DC6B4F8E60B8CF4C | sudo apt-key add -
gpg --export BC528686B50D79E339D3721CEB3E94ADBE1229CF | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf] https://packages.microsoft.com/debian/10/prod buster main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list > /dev/null
echo 'deb https://deb.ln-ask.me/beta buster common local desktop' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cryptoanarchy.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
```

If you're setting up a dedicated full node, you may want to leave out `desktop` component in step 6.

Security features and limitations
---------------------------------

Obviously, whoever promises unhackable product is probably a scammer, so I'm not promising absolute security.
That being said this project has some interesting advantages over manual setup and some existing projects:

* Isolation of all services - the principle of least privilege is followed, each service runs under separate user
  with access restricted to the features it needs. For instance, the official BTCPayServer setup uses admin
  macaroon to access LND. This repository uses a special macaroon that prevents spending funds.
* Zero attack surface of Docker.
* Automated setup with declarative approach avoids bugs from typos and tiredness. Such issues can happen very easily
  when setting up manually.
* If you're a newbie, letting someone experienced in information security help you leads to better security.
* All packages have signatures checked, some even had code reviewed. To my knowledge various Docker setups don't
  check signatures, so this project should be safer.
* All official builds are performed in a dedicated Qubes VM, which should make it very hard to compromise.
* All GPG keys are checked with [`sqck`](https://github.com/Kixunil/sqck).
* Almost all packages are built deterministically

Known room for improvement:

* The builds could be made safer by reviewing Debian build tools and making sure they can't be compromised by bad
  inputs. Then reviewing all build systems to make sure they either don't execute custom build-time logic or
  isolate such login in a separate VM.
* `thunderhub` could be built deterministically
* **Neither** the code nor the output was widely reviewed by **independent** developers
* Automated backups could be added - this is high priority issue that should be solved in upcoming months. (#53)

That being said, I don't know of a comparable project that has significatnly better security. Would love to learn
if there is such.

About this **GitHub** repository
--------------------------------

This **GitHub** repository contains a set of makefiles and other tools to build the **Debian** repository.
It's useless to you unless you are trying to build it on your own or help with development.

Build Dependencies
------------------

The only officially supported OS for building and running is currently **Debian 10 (Buster)**!
It may work on recent version of Ubuntu and derived systems, but it's not tested. Contributions
(trying it and reportin) welcome!
This part is relevant only if you want to develop the repository or build it on your own.
Only needed the first time:

```
sudo apt-get install cargo npm ruby-mustache
# Required version >= 0.1.1
cargo install --git https://github.com/Kixunil/debcrafter
cargo install cfg_me
make build-dep
```

Building
--------

`make`
